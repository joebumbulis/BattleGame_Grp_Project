#Project Presentation Outline

## Introduction
### Team Name: J-BAD's

#### Danielle:
"Our Project was to create a classic battle style game, where a human player fights against a computer player.
Then name of our game is 'Motherflippin' Rap Battle'!! 
Our inspiration came from Joe, that we didn't want anyone to die, hence the Rap Battle!

#### Joe:
"The instructions were to Use constructors and prototypes to create the characters.
 What pages a user will see as they play the game (such as starting a new game,
 selecting a character, battling, and winning/losing). What the character constructor create,
 and what methods a character could have (for example, an attack method, a health property,
 a special power property, a defense method).
 How the different events that occur (like a successful attack)
 in the game will affect the character instances."
 
 #### Andres:
 Talk about our work flow-- "Wireframes, the importance of workflow, using github and Trello
 were essential to the finished product! 
 
 #### Bekah:
 Closing of oral presentation: "(Insert in your own words) Our game works like: (run through 
 a short demo showcasing the code/game)"
